# Character Questions

Character Questions is a WIP module for Foundry VTT designed to assist GMs in guiding their players through character development. This module provides a curated list of categorized questions that gamemasters can use to prompt discussions with their players, helping them develop and understand their characters better.
The module posts a random question to chat (for GMs) based on the different selected categories.
